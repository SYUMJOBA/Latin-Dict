# Latin Dict
 Un dizionario open source, per studenti e professori

# Goals
 Mettere dentro il più vocaboli possibile, in Latino, con traduzione in italiano
 Creare un algoritmo di ricerca ottimizzato 
 Tutto in C++, forse in futuro si cambierà, ma per ora non penso proprio


# For those who are willing to contribute:
    If you want to help, just hit me up via mail, we'll talk a few moments there, I'm introvert but friendly
    If you have ideas for corrections or anything, just let me know, I want this dictionary to be 

    Yes this project (as me) is bilingual, the code is written in english because I just prefer

    Note: to avoid fat, I included <iostream> and <string> already in dictfunctions. So I don't include them twice. It still compiles and run succesfully so it's ok
